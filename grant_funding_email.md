# Grant Funding Application: CareMatch AI - Revolutionizing Healthcare Access in Africa

**Subject:** Request for Grant Funding: CareMatch AI - AI-Powered Healthcare Platform Bridging the Gap in African Healthcare

Dear [Grant Organization Name],

I am writing to request grant funding for **CareMatch AI**, an innovative AI-powered healthcare platform designed to address critical healthcare gaps in Africa, with Nigeria as our primary focus for scaling. Our mission is to leverage artificial intelligence to enrich and support both healthcare practitioners and patients, creating a more accessible, efficient, and comprehensive healthcare ecosystem.
